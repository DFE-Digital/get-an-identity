                <p>Teaching services accounts are new. They let teachers and teaching professionals access different DfE services with one login. You can also update your details with DfE in one place.</p>
                <p>At the moment there are only a few DfE services using Teaching services accounts. In the future, you’ll be able to use your account details to sign in to most DfE teaching services.</p>
