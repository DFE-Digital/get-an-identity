                    <p>DfE Identity accounts are new. They let teachers and teaching professionals access different DfE services with one sign in. You can also update your details with DfE in one place.</p>
                    <p>If we already have your details in our records, we’ll try to link them with your new DfE Identity account. Some of your details may be different now, but you can change them in your account.</p>
                    <p>At the moment there are only a few DfE services using DfE Identity accounts. In the future, you’ll be able to use your account details to sign in to most DfE teaching services.</p>
